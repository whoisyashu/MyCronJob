# 🕒 MyCronJob

MyCronJob is a lightweight website uptime monitoring system built for **small business owners and solo founders** who don’t have a dedicated backend or DevOps team.

It continuously monitors websites, logs their health, and sends **email alerts** when a website goes down — and again when it recovers.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

For many small businesses, a website is the core of their business. However:

- Websites can crash at **unexpected times** (e.g., late night or early morning)
- Business owners are often **unaware** of downtime
- No backend or monitoring team is available to notify them
- Downtime can result in:
  - loss of sales
  - loss of user trust
  - poor customer experience

There is a need for a **simple, automated system** that notifies the owner immediately when their website goes down.

---

## ✅ Solution

MyCronJob solves this problem by:

- Automatically checking websites at regular intervals
- Detecting downtime using HTTP status codes
- Sending **email alerts** when a website goes DOWN
- Sending a **recovery email** when the website comes back UP
- Providing a dashboard to visualize:
  - current website status
  - uptime percentage
  - last downtime duration
  - historical status timeline (🟢 UP / 🔴 DOWN)

All checks and alerts happen **automatically**, without manual intervention.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- Built with React + Vite
- User authentication (Login / Register)
- Dashboard to:
  - add and delete websites
  - view live website status
  - view uptime percentage
  - view last downtime duration
  - view status history graph
- Real-time updates using WebSockets

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- JWT-based authentication
- REST APIs for websites and status logs
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- MongoDB for persistent storage

### Worker
- Runs as a background process
- Uses cron scheduling
- Pings websites on a fixed interval
- Retry logic to avoid false downtime alerts
- Creates immutable status logs
- Sends:
  - downtime email alerts
  - recovery email alerts
  - real-time events to backend

---

## ✨ Core Features

- ✅ Website uptime monitoring
- 🔁 Retry logic before declaring downtime
- 📧 Email alerts (DOWN & RECOVERY)
- 📊 Uptime percentage calculation
- ⏱ Last downtime duration
- 🟢🔴 Status history timeline
- ⚡ Real-time updates via WebSockets
- 🔐 Secure JWT authentication
- 🧩 Clean separation of backend and worker

---

## 🧪 Alert Logic (No Spam)

- Email alerts are sent **only on state change**
  - UP → DOWN → alert email
  - DOWN → UP → recovery email
- No repeated or spam notifications
- Initial checks do not trigger false alerts
